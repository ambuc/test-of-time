# The Test of Time
This is a history game built by [Julian Rosenblum](http://julianrosenblum.com/) and myself, where you place events chronologically on a timeline, for as long as you can, without messing up. It was built with data [Daniel Hienert](http://vizgr.org/historical-events/) and his [paper](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-868/paper4.pdf), in which he extracts historical events from Wikipedia.

That's all!
